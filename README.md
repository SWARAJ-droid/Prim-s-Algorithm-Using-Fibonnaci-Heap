Prim-s-Algorithm-Using-Fibonnaci-Heap
=====================================

 Implement Primâ€™s Minimum Cost Spanning Tree algorithm, MST, using a simple  data structure and fibonacci heap, called heap scheme, and measure the  relative performance of the two implementations.    Both of the schemes used the adjacency lists representation for graphs. The simple scheme used  an array to determine the next edge to include while the f-heap scheme uses a Fibonacci heap.
